# Tanzanian Water Pump Analysis
## Abstract
The focus of this project is to analyze and predict the functionality of water pumps in Tanzania. Various data mining techniques have been employed on the provided dataset and then multiple  machine learning algorithms were used to train and evaluate the models. By analyzing the various features of the water points, the models were able to pinpoint the factors that contribute towards the operational status of the water pumps with a reasonable level of accuracy. Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, GradientBoost and TabNet algorithms were implemented along with a stack classifier to predict the accuracy of the model. An accuracy of 80.68 was achieved after comparing the models.
## Introduction
The data that was analyzed was obtained from an online data mining competition (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/). The data has been derived from  the Taarifa waterpoints dashboard, a Tanzanian innovation initiative that compiles data from the ministry of water there. The collection comprises 40 variables, such as waterpoint type, water quality, and water amount, and information on more than 59,400 water points. The goal of this dataset is to predict the functional status of a water point, which can be classiffied as ”functional”, ”functional but needs repair”, or ”non functional”. Based on the data analysis the research question on focus is, how does geographic factors such as geographic location, extraction type, source of water, management group and population predict the overall performance (functionality, water quality, cost) of waterpoints in Tanzania’s different water basins?
## Data set
The dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables. The summary statistics reveal that the range and mean values differ significantly among the numerical variables. Similarly, the categorical variables have a varying number of unique values, with some columns having only one unique value. Overall, the dataset contains a wide range of information that has to be explored further to gain insights into the water wells in Tanzania.
